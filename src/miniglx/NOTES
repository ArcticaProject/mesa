CLIENT-SIDE CODE (LIBGL.SO)
---------------------------

dispatch.c
	
	- The libGL.so dispatch table.

dri_util.c
dri_util.h

	- Previously part of the driver.so file.
	- Contains a lot of window-system specific code, but has only
	  a single entrypoint.  By moving this to live in libGL.so,
	  these details are made more "private" to libGL.so.  We'd
	  probably have to reproduce an unfeasible amount of X's
	  clientside internals to keep this in the driver.so file.


miniglx.c

	- Miniglx bindings.  Includes things like XOpenDisplay as well
          as more standard GLX fare.

miniglxP.h 
	
	- Cut down version of glxclient.h

drm.h
sarea.h
	- kernel interfaces.  Note that not all drivers will talk to a
	  kernel module

xf86drm.c

	- The drm* commands.  These are also currently present in the
	  loadable driver.  Some of these are called by dri_util.c.
	  May be possible to load the driver.so module before calling
	  any of these, or else to remove them from the driver.so
	  module and have them live here (** compatibility concerns).

xf86drm.h
	- Interfaces for xf86drm.c.


These build a libGL.so which can load binary modules for an fbdev
environment.  Those binary modules *could* work with X11, but
currently are incompatible with the X11 modules due to the movement of
shared code into libGL.so -- in particular dri_util.c and xf86drm.c
which were previously part of the loadable driver.
