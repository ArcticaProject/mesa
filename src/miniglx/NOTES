CLIENT-SIDE CODE (LIBGL.SO)
---------------------------

dispatch.c
	
	- The libGL.so dispatch table.

dri_util.c
dri_util.h

	- Previously part of the driver.so file.
	- Contains a lot of window-system specific code, but has only
	  a single entrypoint.  Better located in libGL.so?


glxclient.h
	- removed

glxext.c
	- removed

miniglx.c

	- Miniglx bindings.  Not currently referenced by the makefile.

miniglxP.h 
	
	- Cut down version of glxclient.h


SERVER-SIDE CODE
----------------

dri.c
	- Code from the X server for
	       - kernel module loading & initialization.
	       - responses to driver.so queries (see XF86dri.c)

dri.h
dristruct.h
	- Structs for dri.c



XF86dri.c

	- The XF86DRI* commands.  In normal dri, these send protocol
          requests to the server.  Here they can talk directly to
          dri.c.  In fact they should probably be pulled directly into
          dri.c

xf86drm.c

	- The drm* commands.  These are also currently present in the
	  loadable driver.  Some of these are called by dri.c via
	  radeon_dri.c.  May be possible to load the driver.so module
	  before calling any of these, or else to remove them from the
	  driver.so module and have them live here (** compatibility
	  concerns).

xf86drm.h
	- Interfaces for xf86drm.c.
