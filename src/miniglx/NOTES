CLIENT-SIDE CODE (LIBGL.SO)
---------------------------

dispatch.c
	
	- The libGL.so dispatch table.

dri_util.c

glxclient.h

glxext.c

Makefile

CLIENT-SIDE CODE (LIBGL.SO)
---------------------------

miniglx.c

	- Miniglx bindings.  Not currently referenced by the makefile.

SERVER-SIDE CODE
----------------

dri.c
	- Code from the X server for
	       - kernel module loading & initialization.
	       - responses to driver.so queries (see XF86dri.c)

dri.h
dristruct.h
	- Structs for dri.c


radeon_common.h
	- Kernel structs for radeon_dri.c.
	- Only a fraction of this is referenced.

	--> Why not just reference the kernel include directly?

	--> The radeon client driver also pulls this in, so maybe it's
            better to keep it.  (Though it's never been explained why
            the client driver can't just reference the kernel header
            directly either).

radeon_dri.c

	- Radeon-specific hardware initialization has been pulled into
          this file from radeon_driver.c and radeon_dri.c in the DDX
          driver.

radeon_dri.h

	- Define the struct passed to radeon_dri.so for it's
          initialization.
	- Also referenced by the files used to build radeon_dri.so.
	- Why isn't this a part of radeon_common.h?
	

radeon.h

	- Define the RADEONInfoPtr structure.

XF86dri.c

	- The XF86DRI* commands.  In normal dri, these send protocol
          requests to the server.  Here they can talk directly to
          dri.c.  In fact they should probably be pulled directly into
          dri.c

xf86drm.c

	- The drm* commands.  These are also currently present in the
	  loadable driver.  Some of these are called by dri.c via
	  radeon_dri.c.  May be possible to load the driver.so module
	  before calling any of these, or else to remove them from the
	  driver.so module and have them live here (** compatibility
	  concerns).

xf86drm.h
	- Interfaces for xf86drm.c.
